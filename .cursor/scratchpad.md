# Website Refresh Project: Consulting Transformation

## Background and Motivation

**Date Started:** October 24, 2025

**Project Goal:** Transform personal website from casual personal blog to professional consulting page focused on Blockchain and AI consulting services.

**Current State:**
- Website is deployed at https://markosuniverse.xyz/ via GitHub Pages/Hostinger
- Built with basic HTML/CSS/JS (jQuery-based template called "Namari")
- Current content is very personal: travel blogs, personal development goals, hobbies (kombucha, astronomy)
- Tone is casual and intimate ("2-hearted", "loving and sometimes lonely person")
- Has sections: About (personal story), Current Projects (2024 personal goals), Blog (travel articles)

**Desired State:**
- Professional consulting website
- Focus: Blockchain & AI consulting services
- Services: Educational, speaking, go-to-market strategy, development, growth
- Modern, professional appearance suitable for business validation (e.g., false self-employment checks)
- Maintain simplicity - user doesn't want to invest excessive time

**Key Constraint:** Keep changes simple and efficient. Don't overengineer.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Content Transformation
- **Challenge:** Current content is deeply personal. Need to pivot to professional consulting value proposition.
- **Approach:** Rewrite sections to highlight expertise, services, and professional credibility while maintaining authenticity.

### Design Modernization
- **Current:** Basic template from early coding days, looks dated
- **Target:** Modern, clean, professional design that conveys consulting expertise
- **Consideration:** Keep existing HTML/CSS/JS structure (no framework rewrite) for simplicity

### Tone Shift
- **From:** Casual, vulnerable, personal ("ex-VC guy", "lonely person", "kombucha fermenting")
- **To:** Professional, authoritative, service-oriented while keeping personality
- **Balance:** Professional enough for clients, authentic enough to be human

### Technical Considerations
- Current stack: Static HTML/CSS/JS with jQuery plugins
- Keep deployment method: GitHub Pages
- Maintain existing file structure for simplicity
- Update social links (Twitter handle changed from @cryp1312 to @markowifk)
