# Marko Stokic - AI-Focused Video Script
## "The Trust Architect: Building AI That Respects Humans"

---

## REFRAMED NARRATIVE

**Core Message Shift:** Instead of "crypto guy who found AI," position as **"someone who spent 7 years solving trust and identity problems - exactly what AI needs now."**

This reframe matters because:
- AI companies are desperate for people who understand **AI safety, trust, and governance**
- Your DID (Decentralized Identity) work is directly applicable to **AI agent identity & verification**
- Privacy-preserving AI is a massive growth area
- You've been thinking about "trust in autonomous systems" since before ChatGPT existed

## REVISED VIDEO STRUCTURE

### NEW OPENING HOOK (0:00 - 0:08)

**Option A - Question Hook:**
> *"How do you trust something that thinks for itself?"*
> *"I've spent 7 years answering that question."*

**Option B - Contrast Hook:**
> *"2017: Everyone asked how to trust a blockchain."*
> *"2025: Everyone asks how to trust an AI agent."*
> *"Same question. I've been working on it the whole time."*

This immediately positions you as an **AI trust expert**, not a crypto-to-AI pivoter.

### ACT 1: THE QUESTION (0:00 - 0:20)
**"Trust in Autonomous Systems"**

**SCENE 1.1 - The Hook** (0:00-0:08)
- Visual: Split screen - blockchain nodes on left, AI neural network on right
- Text: *"How do you trust something that thinks for itself?"*
- Both sides merge into one
- Subtitle: *"I've spent 7 years answering this question."*

**SCENE 1.2 - The Origin** (0:08-0:20)
- Visual: Nihilist Penguin (but briefer - 3 seconds max)
- Text: *"2017. While others saw speculation..."*
- Transition to code/whitepapers
- Text: *"...I saw a trust problem worth solving."*
- Subtitle: *"Decentralized systems. Verifiable identity. Trustless coordination."*

**Why this works:** Frames the crypto era as *training for AI governance*, not separate from it.

### ACT 2: THE EXPERTISE (0:20 - 0:50)
**"Building Trust Infrastructure"**

**SCENE 2.1 - Identity Systems** (0:20-0:32)

- Subtitle: *"Built identity infrastructure used by millions."*

**SCENE 2.2 - The Insight** (0:32-0:42)
- Visual: Transition animation - human identity → AI agent identity
- Text: *"Then I realized..."*
- Text: *"AI agents need identity too."*
- Visual: AI agents interacting, needing verification
- Subtitle: *"Who built this agent? What can it access? Can we trust it?"*

**SCENE 2.3 - The Convergence** (0:42-0:50)
- Visual: Oasis Protocol with AI overlay
- Text: *"Oasis Protocol Foundation"*
- Title: *"Head of AI"*

## ADDITIONAL SUGGESTIONS FOR YOUR WEBSITE

Beyond the video, consider adding:

**1. Reframe your headline:**
- Current vibe: "Head of AI at crypto company"
- Better: "AI Trust & Strategy Leader | Building systems humans can trust"

**2. Lead with AI credentials:**
- Forbes AI articles first
- Speaking at AI conferences first
- Oasis AI work first
- THEN the identity/privacy background as "how I got here"

**3. Add an "AI Philosophy" section:**
- Your view on AI agent trust
- Why identity verification matters for AI
- The privacy-AI intersection

**4. Case studies if possible:**
- "How I led Oasis's AI strategy to..."
- Specific AI initiatives you've driven

## PROMPT MODIFICATION FOR CLAUDE CODE

When generating this version, modify the prompt to emphasize:

```
Create a 90-second Remotion video positioning Marko Stokic as an AI Trust & Strategy leader.

KEY NARRATIVE: He's spent 7 years solving "how do you trust autonomous systems" - first with decentralized identity, now with AI. This isn't a crypto-to-AI pivot story; it's expertise that became essential when AI needed the same solutions.

OPEN WITH: "How do you trust something that thinks for itself? I've spent 7 years answering that question."

EMPHASIZE:
- AI agent identity and verification (his DID work applies directly)
- Forbes articles on AI trust (lead with "Can We Ever Trust AI Agents?")
- Privacy-preserving AI at Oasis
- Speaking at AI conferences (OpenAGI Summit prominent)

CLOSE WITH: "Building AI systems humans can trust" - not crypto/web3 messaging.

Tone: Executive, authoritative, forward-looking. This is for AI company recruiters.
```
